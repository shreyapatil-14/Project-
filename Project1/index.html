<p style="color:navy; font-style:bold;">Fish are a very high source of protein and have great nutritional value.</p>
<p style="color:navy; font-style:bold">Fish production was initially dependent on fish capturing
   However most of the captured fish were used for industrial purposes and were  hardly consumed by man.
<p style="color:navy; font-style: bold">An alternative method to increase fish production was devised that includes farming and husbandry of economically important aquatic organisms.</p>
<p style="color:blue; font-size:20px; font-style:bold">This is known as FISH FARMING.</p>

<p style="color: navy; font-style: bold">In this method, commercial breeding and raising of fish is done in enclosures or in fish tanks.Fish farming is the fastest growing area of animal food production.
